#                               SC1015 Project: An in-depth analysis of Amazon Sales and Review Data 

## Background  

Companies tend to analyze their sales data to decide the direction of their sales. After all, this is the most accessible and commonly analyzed data. One of such companies is Amazon, a global online retailer. Online shopping websites contain a repository of reviews by shoppers. These reviews are used by other shoppers to decide whether a product is worth purchasing.

## Problem Definition

We aim to put the underutilized data of user purchase history and product description to better use, by building a recommendation system based on TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity of reviews to improve user experience. This can complement the existing sales data analysis, to improve customer satisfaction in online retail stores, as well as revenue.

 
## Dataset  
We have chosen a dataset from Kaggle that illustrates user reviews of Amazon products over a given period. The link to the data set is at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karkavelrajaj/amazon-sales-dataset/data. It is built from scraping product details from the official Amazon website. The data contains 1351 rows and is organized into 16 categories, which include key categories such as product_name, category, actual price, discounted price, rating, and review content, which we analysed in the project.
 

## Methods
We have followed the process of data analytics as taught in the SC1015 course, in the order of data extraction, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data visualization as well as sentiments analysis using WordCloud. We analysed the review scores to find out the popularity of products. We have included the use of Sci-Kit Learn Toolkit(SK Learn), an open source data analytics library used to implement machine learning models.  

## Tools Used
Box Plot, Bar Plot, Correlation Matrix, Scatterplot, WordCloud

## Conclusion
We have come up with a recommendation system that provides convenience for users as they can find products that they are most likely to be interested in. Additionally, the Exploratory Data Analysis has helped us learn about what kind of products are popular amongst shoppers and the average discounts that we can set for each category/sub-category of product. With our key results presented in the video, we can gear the strategy towards higher customer satisfaction, which can result in more sales and thus higher revenue. 


## Lesson Learnt
We learnt how to use new models such as WordCloud, TF-IDF Vectorizer and Cosine Similarity.
We further learnt that we can use words to better understand reviews, and unlock the potential in data analytics. Last but not least, we gained better sense of privacy and ethics, in which users have to give consent for their reviews to be used for analytics purposes.
