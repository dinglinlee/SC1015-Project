SC1015 Project - An in-depth analysis of Amazon Sales Review

Problem Definition: Online shopping contains a repository of reviews by shoppers. These reviews are usually used by other shoppers to decide whether a product is worth purchasing.

Project Objective: We aim to increase Amazon’s sales as well as shopper satisfaction through analysing shoppers’ reviews, and building a recommendation system based on the reviews.
